The project is structured to ensure clear version control and accessibility for different versions of a linear regression model. The scripts/ directory contains two training scripts: model1.py, which trains a model using only X1 as the predictor and saves it as model_v1.pkl, and model2.py, which incorporates X2 as an additional independent variable and saves the updated model as model_v2.pkl in the models/ directory.
